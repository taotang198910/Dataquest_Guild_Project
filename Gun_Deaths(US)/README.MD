# Gun Deaths in the US

In this project, I have worked with Jupyter notebook, and analyzed data on gun deaths in the US. I have also explored the dataset, and try to find patterns in the demographics of the victims.
The dataset came from [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), and can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data). 
The dataset is stored in the `guns.csv` file. It contains information on gun deaths in the US from 2012 to 2014.

## Installation: 
You can view `US Gun Deaths.ipynb` directly on github, or clone the repository and open on Jupyter Notebook.

## Requirements:
- Python3
- Jupyter Notebook
