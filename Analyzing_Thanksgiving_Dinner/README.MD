# Thanksgiving Dinner

In this project, I have worked with Jupyter notebook, and analyzing data on Thanksgiving dinner in the US. The dataset came from [FiveThirtyEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/), and can be found [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/thanksgiving-2015).
The dataset is stored in the `thanksgiving.csv` file.

## Installation:
You can view US Gun Deaths.ipynb directly on github, or clone the repository and open on Jupyter Notebook.
