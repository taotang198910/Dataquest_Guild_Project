# The Gender Gap In College Degrees

## Introduction:
In this project, I have tried to maximize the data-ink ratio of charts, which is the fractional amount of the plotting area dedicated to displaying the data.

Non-data ink includes any elements in the chart that don't directly display data points. This includes tick markers, tick labels, and legends. Data ink includes any elements that display and depend on the data points underlying the chart. In a line chart, data ink would primarily be the lines and in a scatter plot, the data ink would primarily be in the markers. As we increase the data-ink ratio, we decrease non-data ink that can help a viewer understand certain aspects of the plots. We need to be mindful of this trade-off as we work on tweaking the appearance of plots to tell a story, because plots we create could end up telling the wrong story.

To improve the data-ink ratio:
- Remove all of the axis tick marks.
- Hide the spines, which are the lines that connects the tick marks, on each axis.
