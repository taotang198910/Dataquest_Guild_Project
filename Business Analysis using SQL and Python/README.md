# Business Analysis Using SQL and Python


In this project, I have worked with a modified version of a database called [Chinook](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database). The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store.
The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases. This information is contained in eleven tables.

I have used SQL to answer business questions, and then used Python Matplotlib to visualize the answers:
* Which genres sell the most tracks in the USA?
* Which artist and his/her album is used in the most Rock playlists?
* WHat is the total dollar amount of sales assigned to each sales support agent within the company?
* The sales from each difference country such as total number of customers, total value of sales, average value of sales per customer
, and average order value.
* Which countries have potential for growth?
* What percentage of purchases are individual tracks vs whole albums,so that management can use this data to understand the effect this decision might have on overall revenue?
