# Earnings Bsed on College Majors

In this guided project, I explored how using the pandas plotting functionality along with the Jupyter notebook interface allows us to explore data quickly using visualizations.
The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

Using visualizations, we can start to explore questions from the dataset like:
- Do students in more popular majors make more money? `Using scatter plots`
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female? `Using histograms`
- Which category of majors have the most students? `Using bar plots`

## Installation:
You can view `Visualizing_Earnings_Based_On_College_Majors.ipynb` directly on github, or clone the repository and open on Jupyter Notebook.
