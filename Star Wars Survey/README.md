# Star Wars Movies Survey

## Introduction
The team at FiveThirtyEight became interested in answering some questions about Star Wars fans, such as **does the rest of America realize that “The Empire Strikes Back” is clearly the best of the bunch?**
So the team collected data addressing this question, and received 835 total responses, which you download from [their GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey).

For this project, I have been cleaning and exploring the data set on the Star Wars movies in Jupyter notebook.

## Installation
You can view `Star_Wars_Movies.ipynb` directly on GitHub, or clone the repository and open on Jupyter Notebook.
